- [Lecture note](https://skojaku-classroom.notion.site/Applied-Soft-Computing-4902112081a5430abfb2471f4c03e6a1?pvs=74)
- [Review sheet](review-sheet.md)
- [Exam question example](exam-examples.md)

# Notes
- The review sheet doesnâ€™t entirely cover the lecture notes, and there might be some questions that cannot be answered solely with the information from the review sheet.
- The final exam has more than 50 questions, meaning that you have to read the questions and decide your answer in less than 2.4 mins. There won't be much time to reference the review sheet frequently. So don't consider the review sheet as your external memory.
